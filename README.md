# VLM-Instruct-FastGS
VLM-Instruct-FastGS (Vision-Language Model Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting) enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting by leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to intelligently guide the densification process. Under the same iteration budget, our method achieves more complete scene reconstruction through a three-phase semantic guidance strategy.
